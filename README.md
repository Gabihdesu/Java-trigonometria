<h1>Triangle Checker</h1>

<p>  I bearly can reamembear about trigonometry, but this application was really funny to create becouse it envolves a lot of the multiple condition concept </p> 
<p> And I particuly love to write codes with a lot of <strong>if</strong> and <strong>else</strong> situations.</p>

<p>I made this with Netbeans and the interface is a JFrame of Swing</p>
